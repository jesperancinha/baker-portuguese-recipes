# Finantial Transactions in Akka Roadmap

#### Logbook

- 2021/12/08

After more than a whole year of having an article dedicated to the Baker Framework, I have finally decided to take it out of Medium.
There are several reasons for this but, in the end, it all boils down to public interest. This article was a fully dedicated example to how to work with Baker. I had made several parallelisms with actual cooking recipes and the analogy of that to actual banking operations like opening and closing accounts, financial transactions and all things related to how banks work.
I wrote it with a lot of passion because I believed in the product so much. It had a great review in the first month, but then, and very quickly, the public engagement and the interest in it dropped to zero and stayed there for more than a year. It is not easy for me to make such a decision and I truly want to always support former colleagues of mine at ING the best way I can. However, maintaining articles that didn't "struck a chord", not even in the most insignificant possible way, with the general tech world, also means maintenance costs in terms of time and money. This amounts to enough resons to having it taken out.

On the flip side, a new article is coming where I will explore efficient ways to deal with finantial data using Scala. Most likely using Scala and Akka, but that is not yet defined, so please come back later to this repo to check on the progress.
